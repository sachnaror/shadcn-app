# 🎉 Welcome to Shadcn's Crazy Experiment! 🚀

## 🥳 What is this?
This is a delightful little experiment where we play around with Shadcn components. Why? Because who doesn’t like to sprinkle a little fun into their code? It’s like adding chocolate chips to your salad—unexpected but oddly satisfying!

## 🎯 The Goal
In just 5 minutes (or maybe 10 if you stop for coffee), you’ll experience the thrill of creating a registration form that might just revolutionize the way you sign up for newsletters... or not! But hey, at least it's a good excuse to procrastinate on more important tasks.

## 📦 What’s Inside?
- A registration form that collects your email, phone, and password—because why not gather all your secrets?
- A **forgot password** link—because we all forget our passwords like we forget where we parked.
- A success page that celebrates your triumph with a big ol’ “Registration Successful!” message and a log-out button, just in case you want to celebrate your achievement elsewhere.

## 💻 How to Get Started
1. Clone this repository like you’re stealing cookies from the cookie jar:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shadcn-app.git
   cd shadcn-app
   ```
2.	Install the dependencies. It’s like feeding your pet code:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
3. 	Run the app. Watch it come to life like a newborn puppy:
    ```
    npm run dev
    ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the magic happen! ✨

## 🎉 Features

- **Registration Form**: Because entering your personal information online is always a great idea… right?
- **Forgot Password**: For those of us who live in a constant state of forgetfulness.
- **Success Page**: An opportunity to pat yourself on the back for a job well done, even if the job was just filling out a form.

## 😂 Why Shadcn?

Why not? It’s shiny, it’s new, and it sounds like a spell from a wizarding world. Plus, it’s a great way to pretend you’re productive while secretly browsing cat memes.

## 🎈 Disclaimer

This project is purely for fun and experimentation. Use at your own risk. We are not responsible for any spontaneous dance parties that may occur upon successful registration.

## 🙌 Acknowledgments

## 🤔 Have Fun!

Now go forth and experiment! And remember: if you break something, just say it was a feature and move on. Happy coding! 🎈
